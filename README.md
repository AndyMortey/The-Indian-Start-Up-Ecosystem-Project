# The-India-Start-Up-Ecosystem-Project
## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for conducting an analysis of startup funding in India using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework. The analysis aims to provide insights into the funding trends, top sectors, investor behavior, and geographical distribution of startup funding in India. CRISP-DM is a widely used methodology for conducting data mining or data analysis projects. It consists of six phases:
* Business understanding: understanding the needs of my team
* Data understanding: understanding the data and the expected information
* Data preparation: cleaning the data and formatting the data types
* Modelling: manipulating the data to draw insights
* Evaluation: assessing the results against the business objectives
* Deployment: presenting the findings.

## Project Scenario
Your team is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem. As the data expert of the team, you are to investigate the ecosystem and propose the best course of action.
* Analyze funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021.
* Separate data for each year of funding will be provided.
* In these datasets, you'll find the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the investors' information.

## Business Understanding
Understanding the dynamics of start-up funding in India is crucial for investors seeking lucrative opportunities, entrepreneurs planning to launch new ventures, policymakers aiming to foster innovation, and researchers studying the evolving landscape. By analyzing funding trends, we aim to identify patterns, drivers, and key factors influencing investment decisions.

# The-India-Start-Up-Ecosystem-Project
## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for conducting an analysis of startup funding in India using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework. The analysis aims to provide insights into the funding trends, top sectors, investor behavior, and geographical distribution of startup funding in India. CRISP-DM is a widely used methodology for conducting data mining or data analysis projects. It consists of six phases:
* Business understanding: understanding the needs of my team
* Data understanding: understanding the data and the expected information
* Modelling: manipulating the data to draw insights
* Evaluation: assessing the results against the business objectives
* Deployment: presenting the findings.
